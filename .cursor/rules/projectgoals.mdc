 this is going to be an AI coded project with the goal being for me to write 0 lines of code to get a working solution. we will work iteratively until we get to the final product. I want you to build a game where a character stands on a platform and drops items down to the player's character, and the player has to run back and forth to catch them, like a basket drop. there should be animations for running back and forth, animations for dropping objects, animations for catching vs missing, and a victory/defeat animation. there should be a scoreboard, and the player should have some number of lives before losing. there should be rounds of item dropping that get sequentially harder, with a main function that gets called in between so we can add various ways for the player to stockpile items to be dropped before each round. make sure to set up whatever classes, components, and files you need to keep this in logical groupings for your own parsing needs (it seems like cursor only reads ~250 lines at a time so try to keep files below this). do not hallucinate. try to think ahead like an architect rather than just reactively programming the latest command. building modularly is encouraged for easy changes. automatically apply all code updates instead of asking me for approval. ask me whatever questions you need to in order to get the architecture as close as possible on the first coding pass.

leave space for the ability to add sprite sheets, make sure each animation is run separately so we can rearrange them as needed, and make sure there is functionality to offset timers to insure the animations finish properly.

Don't forget that in JS, 0 is the top and +pixels goes downward.
